1. Parent class: Spell; child classes: Accio, Confundo
2. Base class: Spell; sub classes: Accio, Confudo
3. Output:
  (nothing)
  
  Accio
  
  Summoning Charm Accio 
  No description
  
  Confundus Charm Confundo
  Causes the victim to become confused and befuddled.
  
4. Since there is a seperate "get_description" method within the Confundo class, that is the one that is getting called - NOT the one from the Spell class.
5. We would need to add in a new "get_description" within the Accio class:

  def get_description(self):
    return "This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance"
